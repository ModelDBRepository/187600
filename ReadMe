If you use this software please reference our paper. 
This package have several matlab codes and functions. The main codes just to do simulations 
of figures are: Tekaetal2016_SingleGates.m and Tekaetal2016_SingleAP.m.
 In the file Tekaetal2016_SingleGates.m, there are  6 sections that compute the simulations and
analyze the results for Figures 1 and 2 of our paper. Section 1-3 simulate voltage clamp on the individual gates having 
power-law dynamcis. They correspond to figure 1 in the paper.Section 4-6 analyze the data produced by section 1-3.
 In the file Tekaetal2016_SingleAP.m,  sections 7-9 generate a few action potentials. 
Sections 10-12 analyze these data which corresponds to Figure 2. 
The other figures were generate by running sections 7-9 for very long
periods of time. They require super-computer resources and multiple days
of simulation time. You can request the data files.
